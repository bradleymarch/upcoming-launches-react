Immertec's takehome challenge
===

# Your mission

Hey Web Application Developer! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to carve out 2 hours and create a simple React application using an API service defined below.

> It's important that you spend about two hours (and not too much more!) on this project. If you can finish faster -- great! If not, no worries. Submit what you have.

# Your task

The home page of your app shows a list of upcoming launches. You decide how you want to order the launches and how they are displayed.

A user should be able to click on a launch in the list to display additional details about the launch. The API includes many other pieces of information that you can choose to include on this page.

Once finished, send your solution files to casey@immertec.com or push up to a GitHub repository for review.

# Some tips

- Everything is setup for you to get up and running fast. We're using React here, but feel free to use whatever you feel best suites the task.
- Use any libraries, frameworks or modules you like.
- Assume you only need to support modern evergreen browsers.
- We love things that are neatly presented, bonus points for styling.
